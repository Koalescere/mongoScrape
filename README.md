# mongoScrape

Whenever a user visits the site, the app will scrape stories from the new york times and display them to the user. Each scraped article will be saved to the application database. At a minimum, the app will scrape and display the following information for each article:


Headline - the title of the article
Summary - a short summary of the article
URL - the url to the original article


Users will be able to leave comments on the articles displayed and revisit them later. The comments will be saved to the database and associated with their articles. Users will also be able to delete comments left on articles. 

All stored comments will be visible to every user.
